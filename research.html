                    <p>My research focuses on the theoretical underpinnings of federated and decentralized learning, with a particular emphasis on developing and analyzing optimization algorithms. I am interested in understanding the convergence properties and generalization capabilities of these methods under realistic and challenging conditions, such as non-convex loss landscapes and data heterogeneity.</p>
