                    <p>I am a final-year Ph.D. candidate in Theoretical Machine Learning, specializing in Federated Learning, Non-Convex Optimization, and Online Learning. My research lies at the intersection of mathematics and modern machine learning, with a particular focus on building rigorous theoretical foundations for distributed and large-scale learning systems.</p>

                    <p>My expertise spans across frontend and backend development, database design, and cloud technologies. I have worked extensively with modern frameworks and tools, contributing to both enterprise applications and open-source projects. My approach combines technical excellence with user-centered design principles.</p>

                    <p>Before my current role, I gained valuable experience working on diverse projects ranging from e-commerce platforms to data visualization tools. I hold a degree in Computer Science and continuously update my skills to stay current with emerging technologies and industry best practices.</p>

                    <p>My research interests include web performance optimization, scalable architecture design, and the intersection of artificial intelligence with web development. I'm particularly fascinated by how modern JavaScript frameworks and cloud technologies can be leveraged to build next-generation applications.</p>

                    <p>I actively contribute to the developer community through <a href="https://github.com/sumitsah" target="_blank" class="link">open-source projects</a>, technical writing, and mentoring junior developers. I believe in the power of collaborative development and continuous learning.</p>
