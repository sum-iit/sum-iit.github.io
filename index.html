                    <p>I am a final-year Ph.D. candidate in Theoretical Machine Learning, specializing in Federated Learning, Non-Convex Optimization, and Online Learning. My research lies at the intersection of mathematics and modern machine learning, with a particular focus on building rigorous theoretical foundations for distributed and large-scale learning systems.</p>

                    <p>I completed my M.Sc. in Mathematics with a strong focus on Real Analysis, Functional Analysis, Operator Theory, Statistical Learning Theory, and Probability Theory, which continues to shape my approach to algorithm design and analysis. My doctoral research seeks to move beyond overly restrictive assumptions in existing federated optimization theory, developing frameworks that hold under practical and realistic conditions.</p>

                    <p>I am also passionate about bridging the gap between provable guarantees and practical implementations, contributing to open-source Python tools and collaborating on projects that translate theory into scalable systems.
                        Throughout my academic journey, I have engaged with a wide range of topics—from spectral graph theory to stochastic processes—while maintaining a unifying goal: to advance machine learning through the lens of rigorous mathematics.</p>
